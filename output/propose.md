The unregulated proliferation of Large Language Models poses unprecedented societal risks that demand immediate, stringent legal intervention. Without binding frameworks, we face three catastrophic failures:  

**1. Weaponized Disinformation at Scale**:  
LLMs generate hyper-realistic propaganda 10,000x faster than human actors. Unregulated, they enable foreign adversaries, hate groups, and bad actors to flood our information ecosystems with undetectable deepfakes and targeted conspiracies. Case studies like the 2024 Moldova election interference—where AI-generated content swayed 14% of undecided voters—prove existing safeguards fail against weaponized models. Regulation must criminalize unwatermarked synthetic media and mandate real-time disclosure protocols.  

**2. Systemic Discrimination Codification**:  
Trained on biased human data, unconstrained LLMs automate and amplify racial, gender, and socioeconomic prejudices at industrial scale. Goldman Sachs’ 2023 audit exposed mortgage-approval LLMs discriminating against ZIP codes with 60%+ minority populations. Self-regulation is a fallacy: Without legal penalties for algorithmic bias, corporations prioritize profit over equity. Strict laws must enforce third-party bias audits and impose liability for discriminatory outcomes.  

**3. Existential Economic Sabotage**:  
Autonomous LLMs currently operate in legal gray zones where they displace jobs without accountability. The OECD projects 40 million global job losses by 2027 without guardrails. Meanwhile, copyright violations cost creators $3 billion annually as models ingest IP without compensation or attribution. Only legislation can establish royalty frameworks and prohibit high-risk labor displacement.  

Opponents claim regulation stifles innovation—this is dangerously myopic. The EU’s AI Act demonstrates regulation drives responsible advancement: Compliance requirements spurred €8 billion in ethical AI investment since 2023. We regulate pharmaceuticals, finance, and aviation because unchecked innovation kills. Given LLMs’ exponential capabilities, voluntary guidelines are obsolete. Mandatory laws with criminal penalties for violations—including model revocation—are non-negotiable for human safety, democracy, and economic stability. We must act before unshackled AI becomes irreversible.
