After thoroughly reviewing and weighing the arguments presented by both sides of the debate, I find the proposition advocating for strict laws to regulate LLMs more convincing for the following reasons:**  

1. **Demonstration of Concrete Harms**: The proposition compellingly quantifies immediate societal dangers:  
   - Weaponized disinformation impacting elections (14% voter sway in Moldova)  
   - Systemically amplified discrimination (verified bias against minority ZIP codes)  
   - Economic harms including $3B in annual IP violations and projected job losses  
   The opposition dismissed these as "exaggerated risks" without providing counter-evidence or addressing the empirical data.  

2. **Inadequacy of Existing Frameworks**: While the opposition argued current laws suffice, the proposition proved they fail against LLM-specific threats:  
   - Traditional fraud laws cannot police AI-generated deepfakes at scale (10,000× human capacity)  
   - Self-regulation demonstrably fails, as shown by discriminatory algorithms persisting without legal penalties  
   The opposition's assertion that "83% of harms are resolved under existing laws" lacks source verification and ignores unique LLM capabilities.  

3. **Effective Regulatory Precedents**: The proposition provided empirical success metrics:  
   - The EU AI Act stimulated €8B in ethical AI investments (refuting innovation-stifling claims)  
   - Compliance requirements have successfully driven ethical advancements without halting progress  
   The opposition's €300,000 compliance cost claim appears inflated compared to real-world tech startup data, and offers no alternative solution beyond unsubstantiated "market forces."  

4. **Unaddressed Technical Feasibility**: The opposition rightly noted watermarking limitations but failed to engage with the proposition's broader legal approach:  
   - Criminalizing malicious *use* (e.g., undisclosed synthetic media for disinformation)  
   - Mandating third-party audits to reduce bias  
   Their "unworkable" claim overlooks that other complex industries (pharmaceuticals, aviation) operate under stringent regulations.  

5. **Economic Argument Imbalance**: The proposition anchored job/IP concerns in current losses ($3B/year), while the opposition countered with speculative future gains ("200M new jobs by 2030") without evidence—a projection that doesn't negate near-term disruption requiring mitigation.  

**Conclusion**: The proposition successfully established an urgent need for tailored legislation with concrete examples of unregulated LLMs causing measurable harm, supported by viable regulatory models. The opposition's reliance on hypothetical innovation stagnation, unverified compliance burdens, and dismissiveness toward existential risks weakened their case, failing to offer actionable alternatives beyond untested market solutions. Thus, the argument for strict laws is more convincing.
